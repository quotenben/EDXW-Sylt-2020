# EDXW-Sylt-2020
This is the updated version of EDXW (Sylt / Westerland) created in 2020 with several fixes and updated taxiways. The scenery is based on the [EDXW scenery by bosun](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/18974-edxw-sylt-airport/ )
made in 2013. He gave me the permission to publish my modified version of his scenery. The scenery was especially made for online flying on networks like VATSIM.
The modified version adds the following things to the scenery:

+ **Apron 4 - where the Marinefliegerlehrgruppe is based - added.**
+ **Scenery Night compatible. All aprons and taxiways got lit up with many lights.**
+ Many static aircrafts were removed and replaced with startup points to offer more stands to online pilots.
+ Taxiways M and P at GAT were added.
+ Taxisigns were updated and new ones were added to improve ease of use.
+ Runway closed markings were made red to improve visibility.
+ Grass and scratches were added to inactive parts of the airport to indicate non-operational parts.
+ Many estethic changes and details were added.
..* Fence textures were changed to a more modern fence.
..* Small details such as chocks, cones and barriers were added to stands.

Unfortunately, due to new taxiways and all the changes the ATC Taxiway Routes needed for AI Aircrafts were affected in a negative way. Due to the changes it 
is possible that parts of the AI Aircrafts are not going to work properly because they are not updated and integrated yet. **Use AI Traffic at your own risk!**

### Requirements

* X-Plane 11.30 or higher
